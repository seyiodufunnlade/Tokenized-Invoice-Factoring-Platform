# Tokenized Invoice Factoring Platform

## Overview

The Tokenized Invoice Factoring Platform is a blockchain-based solution that modernizes traditional invoice factoring. By leveraging smart contracts and tokenization, the platform allows businesses to receive immediate payment on their invoices while providing investors with a new asset class for returns.

## Core Components

### Business Verification Contract
Validates the legitimacy of businesses participating in the platform through digital identity verification, business registration checks, and operational history assessment.

### Invoice Certification Contract
Confirms that goods or services were actually delivered through digital signatures, delivery confirmations, and third-party validations to prevent fraud.

### Risk Assessment Contract
Evaluates the payment probability of each invoice using algorithmic scoring based on the invoice payer's credit history, payment patterns, and industry-specific risk factors.

### Funding Distribution Contract
Manages the early payment process to businesses, handling token distribution, fee calculations, and settlement when the original invoice is paid.
